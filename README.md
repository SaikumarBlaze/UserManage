ðŸš€ User Management System

A simple React-based application that allows users to log in using the [ReqRes API](https://reqres.in/), manage authentication state, and access a user dashboard. The project uses modern tools like React Router, Axios, and TailwindCSS for styling, and demonstrates best practices in form handling and authentication.

## Features

- Login functionality using the ReqRes API.
- Authentication state management with context.
- User redirection based on authentication status.
- Dark mode UI with responsive design.
- Notifications for login success or failure using `react-toastify`.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios, React Toastify, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Reqres API (external API for user data)
- **Authentication**: Basic authentication flow with local state
